dana_task_marker - markers in DANA tasks

dana_xdf_files_tasks_found - list of DANA XDF files

Fujitsu Data Pre-Post_temp (has names) - DANA behavioral results; has names!!1

FujitsuTiers - who's in what tier (also in Go Platypus Dropbox\Science And Research\Data Aquisition)

FujitsuTiersFileUploadCheck - used to check which files Intheon was using when
making reports

individ_report_with_NL, indivi_report2, individ_report.json - ??; JSON exports
but why...

Theta Divided by Alpha - work for FJ presentation in Dec.

tpi_fuj_flanker_rt_per_file_totals - reaction time data (used for some
reason...)

DANA before: Go Platypus Dropbox\Science And Research\Data Aquisition\Fujitsu Study Data\DANA DATA
* also has stress scale, sleep scale, etc.
* WARNING: has subjects' names

Posit/Brain HQ up to Oct. 22: Go Platypus Dropbox\Science And Research\Data Aquisition\Fujitsu Study Data\BrainHQ Data
* training 9-6 to 10-12 is very detailed (at the trail or session level)
* updated training levels completed by subjects is a summary

DANA after: AFAIK, it's in XDF format: C:\Users\suhas\Go Platypus Dropbox\Science And Research\Data Aquisition\Fujitsu Data Post-Testing

DANA tasks and ratios

reaction time (SRT1)
memory search (MS)
attention (CS, aka CSL, CSS)
decision making (GNG)
resting baseline (eyes closed-eyes open)

Workload - Higher Beta/(Theta+Alpha) correlates with higher workload
Memory - Higher Theta/Alpha correlates with better memory
Attention - Lower Theta/Beta correlates with more attention
